## Overview

This is a simple python password generator that prompts a user to generate a secure password and provides the entropy/randomness associated with their password.

While creating this, I realized that it might also be helpful to calculate the bits of entropy as well as the current time to brute force the password using traditional means. My crackable method is not perfect - as it only really accounts for entropy and not previous breaches, etc.
