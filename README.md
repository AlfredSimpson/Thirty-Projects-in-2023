# Thirty Projects in 2023

Hey - maybe you're like me and you're constantly working on projects, but you also absolutely forget to showcase them. Maybe you're also like me and you learn a bunch of languages, tools, etc and then end up forgetting half of it because you're finding something new. 

That's why I'm doing my thirty projects in 2023. I wanted to say 30 in 30 days, but I'll be real: I will not remember to do that. 


# What's coming

I developed a rough outline of projects I want to work on. Will I hold to this list? We'll see! I also created this list for others to reference because so many sites paywall you for ideas on what to build and I'm nobody if not someone who thinks that learning should be free. 

## Languages

I'll be creating these projects using some languages I'm very familiar with, and some that I'm not. 
That means:

 - Python
 - Java
 - JavaScript
 - HTML5
 - CSS
 - SQL
 - PHP
 - Go

## Goal

I want to highlight what I'm capable of without collaboration. But that's not saying you shouldn't do these, too! You could also try to tackle these projects, if you want. If you find a better way to do it, let's collaborate in the future and suggest better changes!

## Project list
Just a rough idea of the projects that I may or may not accomplish in creating in 2023. They tend to get more difficult towards the bottom, so we'll see what I can do. If I add any midway, I'll add them here (if I remember!).

 - [x] Bash: Create a Project Template Generator
 - [ ] Python: Create a password generator that generates secure passwords of varying lengths.
 - [ ] HTML/CSS: Design a simple login form with proper validation checks (e.g., required fields).
 - [ ] JavaScript: Implement a basic client-side input validation for a registration form.
 - [ ] HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Build a responsive website layout with a navigation menu and mobile hamburger menu.
 - [ ] Python: Write a script to check for weak passwords in a list, and suggest stronger alternatives.
 - [ ] PHP: Build a simple content management system (CMS) for a blog with CRUD operations.
 - [ ] Java: Develop a simple file encryption and decryption application using the Caesar cipher.
 - [ ] Go: Implement a basic HTTP server that serves static files and supports TLS encryption.
 - [ ] JavaScript: Create a simple XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability scanner.
 - [ ] Python: Develop a script to check if a website is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
 - [ ] Java: Create a simple keylogger program that logs keystrokes to a local file.
 - [ ] SQL: Create a simple database schema with tables for users and roles (e.g., admin, user, guest).
 - [ ] Go: Write a basic TCP server and client for sending and receiving messages.
 - [ ] PHP: Develop a basic registration and login system using PHP and MySQL.
 - [ ] JavaScript: Create a real-time chat application using WebSockets.
 - [ ] Bash: Create a simple Bash script to backup specified directories or files to a compressed archive (e.g., tar.gz) with a timestamp in its name. The script should allow users to specify the source and destination paths.
 - [ ] Python: Develop a port scanner to identify open ports on a target IP address or domain.
 - [ ] SQL: Write a set of complex SQL queries to extract meaningful information from a large database (e.g., user activity analysis).
 - [ ] Java: Implement a multi-threaded web scraper to extract data from multiple pages simultaneously.
 - [ ] Go: Write a reverse proxy server that forwards incoming requests to one or more backend servers.
 - [ ] PHP/HTML/CSS: Develop a security-focused file upload system with proper file type and size checks.
 - [ ] Go: Develop a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack mitigation system using rate limiting and IP blocking.
 - [ ] Python: Create a network packet sniffer that logs and analyzes network traffic.
 - [ ] JavaScript: Implement a browser fingerprinting technique to uniquely identify users.
 - [ ] Bash: Script that monitors system resources, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network connections. The script should display the information in a human-readable format and allow users to set warning thresholds for each monitored resource.
 - [ ] Java: Create a custom sandbox environment to securely execute untrusted code.
 - [ ] JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Implement a secure Single Sign-On (SSO) system using OAuth2.
 - [ ] Bash: script that parses and analyzes log files (e.g., web server logs or system logs). The script should provide summary statistics, such as the number of errors, most frequent IP addresses, and most common error messages. Users should be able to specify the log file path and desired output format.
 - [ ] PHP: Web application firewall (WAF) that filters and blocks malicious requests.
 - [ ] Bash: perform bulk renaming operations on files in a specified directory. The script should support renaming files based on a given pattern, adding prefixes or suffixes, and modifying file extensions.
 - [ ] Java: Develop a simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic for unusual patterns.
 - [ ] Python: Develop a script to automate vulnerability scanning and reporting for web applications.
 - [ ] Bash: IP Scanner script that scans given IP address range/subnets for any active hosts/open ports. Will use ping, nmap, or nc to complete the scan. It will then display the results in a structured format. Users can specify the target network and scan options
 - [ ] SQL: Script that detects and prevent SQL injection attacks on a given database.
 - [ ] Go: Create a distributed hash table (DHT) for peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.
